"""
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
    Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
    Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
    return [0, 1].

-1 Restate the problem
    - Given a target value and list of number return the inkdices of 2 elements that sum to our target
-2 Ask clarifying questions
    - Will the list be sorted, are we able to sort it?
    - Is there a size limit or constraint?
    - What if we can't find a match?
-3 State your assumptions
    - Each element has only one other solution
    - Don't use the same element twice
-4 Think out loud
  -4a Brainstorm solutions
        - A really brute force way would be to search for all possible pairs of numbers but that would be too slow. Again, it's best to try out brute force solutions for just for completeness. It is from these brute force solutions that you can come up with optimizations.
        - 
  -4b Explain your rationale
        - So, if we fix one of the numbers, say `x`, 
            we have to scan the entire array to find the next number `y`
            which is `value - x` where value is the input parameter.
        
        - The second train of thought is, without changing the array, can we use additional space somehow?
            Like maybe a hash map to speed up the search?

  -4c Discuss tradeoffs
        - We can change (sort) our array so that searching becomes faster, binary search instead of linear. 
        - 
  -4d Suggest improvements

"""Problem: Given an array a of n numbers and a target value t,
            find two numbers in a that sum to t.

    Example input:
        a=[5, 3, 6, 8, 2, 4, 7] and t=10
        â‡’  output: [3, 7] or [6, 4] or [8, 2]
"""

"""Pseudo Approach
    look at each item subtract it from the list, save as remainder variable
    look through the list for remainder if found
        add the index of the number and remainder to one list and
        add the number and remainder to a second list
    after viewing all possible options return/print the 2 lists

    Edge Cases:
        loop range issues
        number and remainder have
            same indexes
            reverse indexes

    Complexity Check:
        After implementing some code go back through and revaluate its time and/or space complexity -- refractor/improve/find more edge cases -- repeat
